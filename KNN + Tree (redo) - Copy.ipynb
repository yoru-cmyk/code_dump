    "The concept is simple: pachinko consists of a box. A ball is thrown in such a way that it reaches the top of the box \n",
    "and goes down due to gravity, navigating obstacles and mazes along the way. \n",
    "\n",
    "When it reaches the bottom, it inevitably ends up in another box.Depending on where the ball lands at the end, you either get other ball (that can be exchanged for prizes), or nothing. \n",

    "See this youtube vid for a better explanation:\n",
    "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tBy2jemw4s\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, the ball will be a datum. The mazes and obstacles will be different clusters. And the ending boxes will be very simple (one or two layers) neural networks specifically trained for the task. It'll make more sense when we get to the code.\n",
